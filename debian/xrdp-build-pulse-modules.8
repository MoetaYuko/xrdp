.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xrdp\-build\-pulse\-modules
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script downloads the sources of pulseaudio corresponding to the
currently installed binary package, then uses it to build the modules
shipped with the xrdp sources to get an audio channel in RDP sessions.
.PP
This is necessary because PulseAduio does not expose all symbols needed for
the build in its header files.
.PP
The modules are installed to /var/lib/xrdp-pulseaudio-installer.
.SH OPTIONS
This utility takes no options.
