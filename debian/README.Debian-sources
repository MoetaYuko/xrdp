Debian xrdp package.
=========================

xrdp 0.4.0 was shipped with a copy of Tahoma font from
Microsoft. Since this fond disallows distribution, it was removed from
upstream tarball. debian/patches/05sans-font.dpatch provides a drop
down replacement that will be used in next upstream release.

Filed removed from upstream tarball: xrdp/Tahoma-10.fv1
Directory removed from upstream tarball: debian
