This package was debianised anew by members of Teckids e.V. with
only marginal guidance from the original Debian xrdp packaging.
It is based on the git “devel” branch of xrdp, as there are no
official tarballs as distfiles any longer.

Some header files and most of xorg/X11R7.6/rdp/ and xorgrdp/

Several files and resources have unclear status and sources:

• missing explicit licence (see above) but require one:
  – sesman/tools/sestest.c
  – xorg/tests/xdemo/yosemite.bmp

• unclear, probably harmless, clarification can’t hurt:
  – tcutils/resources/images/tools.gif
  – xrdp/ad24b.bmp, xrdp/ad256.bmp (IIRC they come from X11)
  – xrdp/cursor0.cur, xrdp/cursor1.cur (probably also X11)
  – xrdp/xrdp24b.bmp, xrdp/xrdp256.bmp (project logo, self-drawn?)
  – xrdp/xrdp_logo.bmp (“connecting…” graphics, self-drawn?)
  – Coding_Style.odt (self-written?)
