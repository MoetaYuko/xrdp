This package was debianised anew by members of Teckids e.V. with
only marginal guidance from the original Debian xrdp packaging.
It is based on the git “devel” branch of xrdp, as there are no
official tarballs as distfiles any longer.

Some header files and most of xorg/X11R7.6/rdp/ and xorgrdp/
come with a variant of the Historical Permission Notice and Disclaimer
which adds an explicit permission to sell, repositions the “without
fee” words, and has a redundant reproduction requirement verbatim
from the MIT licence and uses the MIT disclaimer except disclaiming
liablility by “The Open Group”:

Several binaries and images have unclear status and sources:

• probably not copyright-protected:
  – sesman/chansrv/pcsc/dumps/ (protocol dumps?)
  – sesman/chansrv/wave-format-server.txt (file/protocol dumps or standard)

• generated, plaintext, can almost certainly be regenerated:
  – tcutils/moc_mainwindow.cpp
  – tcutils/qrc_resources.cpp
  – tcutils/tcutils.pro
  – tcutils/ui_mainwindow.h
  – xrdp/rsakeys.ini (looks like a generated RSA key)

• generated, ELF binaries, almost certainly from shipped source:
  – tcutils/tcutils
  – tests/gtcp_proxy/gtcp-proxy

• unclear, probably harmless, clarification can’t hurt:
  – tcutils/resources/images/tools.gif
  – xrdp/ad24b.bmp, xrdp/ad256.bmp (IIRC they come from X11)
  – xrdp/cursor0.cur, xrdp/cursor1.cur (probably also X11)
  – xrdp/xrdp24b.bmp, xrdp/xrdp256.bmp (project logo, self-drawn?)
  – xrdp/xrdp_logo.bmp (“connecting…” graphics, self-drawn?)
  – Coding_Style.odt (self-written?)

• unclear, needs clarification:
  – xorg/tests/xdemo/yosemite.bmp
  – xrdp/sans-10.fv1 (probably transformed from DejaVu Sans somehow)
