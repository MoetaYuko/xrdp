See xrdp.NEWS for any upgrade notes from xrdp 0.6 (Debian jessie);
more testing (conffiles, logfiles, piuparts, etc.) is welcome.

Consider using TLS encryption instead of the default RDP encryption,
but do make sure to test all possible clients, and mind client bugs.
TLS has been tested with Microsoft Remotedesktop in Windows 7 and
above, rdesktop 1.8 and freerdp 1.1 (Remmina, et al).

Another security issue is the disablement of access control by default.
Use at your own risk and inform your users that privacy is possibly not
guaranteed as all users can attach to RDP usersâ€™ sessions locally.

The pulseaudio plugin from sesman/chansrv/pulse should be installed
but cannot be built due to lack of a pulseaudio-modules-dev package
in Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=794692

Upstream is currently working on converting librfxcodec to autotools;
we can then pass --enable-rfxcodec but should invest time into proper
recursive configure (not done yet) and make (partially done); SSE can
be used iff tested beforehand. (Remember x32!)

We currently do not use --enable-xrdpvr (as FFmpeg in squeeze is the last
supported version, but it may be possible to use the one in stretch/sid).
