Consider using TLS encryption instead of the default RDP encryption,
but do make sure to test all possible clients, and mind client bugs.
TLS has been tested with Microsoft Remotedesktop in Windows 7 and
above, rdesktop 1.8 and freerdp 1.1 (Remmina, et al).

Another security issue is the disablement of access control by default.
Use at your own risk and inform your users that privacy is possibly not
guaranteed as all users can attach to RDP usersâ€™ sessions locally.

The pulseaudio plugin from sesman/chansrv/pulse should be installed
but cannot be built due to lack of a pulseaudio-modules-dev package
in Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=794692

We currently do not use --enable-xrdpvr (as FFmpeg in squeeze is the last
supported version, but it may be possible to use the one in stretch/sid).
